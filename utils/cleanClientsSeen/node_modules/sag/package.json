  "readme": "Sag-JS\n======\n\nVersion 0.4.0\nhttp://www.saggingcouch.com\n\nSag-JS is a JavaScript library for working with CouchDB that works in both\nbrowsers and Node.JS. It is a port of the popular Sag PHP library and is\ncompletely API compliant, with the addition of callbacks for dealing with\nJavaScript's asynchronous nature.\n\nSag is designed to not force any particular programming method on its users -\nyou just pass objects in and get objects back. This makes it trivial to\ninclude Sag in your application, build different functionality on top of it,\nand expand Sag to include new CouchDB functionality.\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nNode: `npm install sag` or include the source file in your project.\n\nBrowser: Include the source file in your project and embed it with a script\ntag.\n\nCompatability\n-------------\n\nSag-JS is API compatible with Sag 0.7.1 with a few asynchronous language\nspecific additions.\n\nEach release is tested with an automated testing suite against these\ncombinations of software:\n\n  Apache CouchDB: 1.1.x, 1.2.x, 1.3.x\n\n  Node.JS: 0.8.x and 0.10.x (stable releases only)\n\n  Browsers: FF >= 3.5, Chrome >= 15, and IE >= 7\n\nLower versions will likely work with Sag-JS but are not officially supported,\nso your mileage may vary.\n\nContents\n--------\n\nCHANGELOG                       A detailed list of all changes between\n                                releases, including any breaking changes.\n\nLICENSE                         A copy of the license Sag-JS is released under.\n\nNOTICE                          Copyright notices.\n\nREADME                          This file.\n\nMakefile                        Used to run unit tests, create releases, etc.\n\nsrc/                            This directory contains the pieces of source\n                                code tha will be combined to make the sag.js\n                                file. If you are building from source, then\n                                just run `make` to generate the file.\n\ntests/                          Contains the automated testing suite for\n                                Sag-JS and its own documentation.\n\nError Handling\n--------------\n\nSag's paradigm of simplicity is carried into its error handling by allowing\nyou to send data to CouchDB that will result in errors (ex., malformed JSON).\nThis is because CouchDB knows when there is an error better than Sag. This\nalso makes Sag more future proof, instead of worrying about each of CouchDB's\nAPI changes. Therefore, Sag will only look for Sag-JS interface problems and\nissues that are native to JS, such as passing an int instead of a string.\n\nAll local errors are floated back to your application with exceptions. Sag\ndoes not catch any errors itself, allowing your application to care about them\nor not.\n\nCouchDB errors will be exposed through the response object. Additionally the\nsecond parameter of the callback functions is set to `true` if a non-2xx HTTP\nstatus was returned.\n\nNetworking\n----------\n\nSag-JS automatically detects whether it is in a Node.JS or browser environment\nand selects which networking tools to use accordingly.\n\nNode.JS uses the HTTP module found in every Node.JS release.\n\nBrowser current uses XHR, which makes cross domain requests unfeasible. Future\nversions will include support for cross domain requests.\n\nMore Info\n---------\n\nDetailed documentation of the functions and API are available at\nhttp://www.saggingcouch.com\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nSag-JS is released under the Apache License, version 2.0. See the file named\nLICENSE for more information.\n\nCopyright information is in the NOTICE file.\n",
