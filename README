couchdb-notify
==============

Version 0.1-UNRELEASED

Dependencies
------------

Depends on Perl and the modules: JSON, LWP::UserAgent, and Gtk2::Notify.

Copy or symbolically link the CouchNotify directory into your Perl include
path. For example, if you are running Perl 5.12.4 then put a symbolic link in
/usr/local/lib/perl/5.12.4 pointing to ./CouchNotify.

Install irssi Script
--------------------

See http://scripts.irssi.org/ for how to install an irssi script.

Automatically Running Client
----------------------------

You probably want to run the client.plx code as a cron job so that messages are
automatically picked up from the server. Here is an example crontab line:

*/1 *   * * *   sbisbee DISPLAY=:0.0 /home/sbisbee/src/couchdb-notify/client.plx > /dev/null 2>&1

This line runs every minute as the user 'sbisbee' and redirects any output to
/dev/null. Note that the DISPLAY environment variable is set here - this is
necessary for Gtk2::Notify to know which display to send the notifications to.

Configuring

Why Perl?
---------

Because irssi made me.
